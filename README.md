About:

This project is a java based Evolutionary Computation framework to allow for 
quick testing of heuristic operators in evolutionary algorithms. Generic abstract 
classes are provided to be inherited from, and a common evolutionary algorithm 
base which can be used to quickly test the effect of different selection and recombination
types.

An example of implementing these classes is also included which will find the angles needed
to set a two joint 'arm' to any place the user clicks in a javafx window.
